# About Quiz App 

This aplication is a class task and it was made based on a course on Udemy [1].
As I'd liked to improve my skills on coding and learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I used Portuguese and English langages to build the project.
Also, I'm a newbie using these languages, so, if you'd like to help, feel free to send me pull requests or [contact me!](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@vanessadcamara)

# How it Works

It's a game that you have to answer three generic questions. In the end, it asks you to write an username and save. On Scores, you can see how many points you got and a list of high scores. This app was made with HTML, CSS and JS, no frameworks are used to build it, and the questions were generated using Trivia API's dataset [2, 3].
